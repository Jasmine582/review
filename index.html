            'description': "Growing up and seeing how my parents handled their finances pushed me into having a poverty mindset. I believed that I will never have enough money to achieve my goals or build wealth. But then again, I did not know the definition of what wealth was, since I always heard from my family and friends that wealth was only for rich, white people or eventually we will win the state lottery so thereâ€™s no need to save or invest. When I joined the United States Army I had the mentality that I worked hard so therefore, I deserved to purchase anything I wanted. Little did I know I was racking up $110,000 worth of debt that was not student loans. My debt was a mixture of credit cards, car loans, timeshare and personal loans due to my mom not having life insurance when she passed away from breast cancer. The last year of my military service I had to go through series of workshops which were week long to work on resumes, Linkedin profiles and I remember only having two hours on how to create a budget and find a job. I was supposed to find a job or new career that was in the same salary cap, which is a double edge sword since being in the military I had some many job titles.When I left military service I had 82K in debt and I was determined to get out. I googled everything about getting out of debt, watched YouTube videos, purchased books and eventually after hard work, sweat and tears. I became debt free. I became a certified personal finance coach because I want to help women with their personal finances so they secure that Financial Freedom that they may crave.",
