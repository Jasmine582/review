            'description': "I’ve been living a debt free lifestyle for the past 5+ years. I became a certified Personal Finance Coach because I want to help women gain confidence when it comes to handling their personal finances, and don't have to struggle like so many of us have done before in the past. Growing up and seeing how my parents handled their finances pushed me into having a poverty mindset. I believed that I would never attain enough money to achieve my goals or build financial wealth. But then again, I did not know the definition of what wealth really was, because I had always heard my family friends referring to wealth as only being attainable for the rich or for those lucky people that won the lottery. With that being ingrained in my head for years, I didn’t think there was any point in saving or investing. While serving in the United States Army, I had the mentality that because I worked hard to serve my country through day-to-day soldiering and deployments, I deserved to purchase and have whatever I wanted. Little did I know, this mentality helped me accumulate a substantial amount of debt worth $110,000 that was not from student loans. My debt was a mixture of credit cards, car loans, timeshares, and personal loans due to my mom not having life insurance when she passed away from breast cancer. I have a duty to impart all my knowledge to others to help them achieve financial successes.",
